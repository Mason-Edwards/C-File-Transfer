TODO: 
    need to add file sharing ability to be able to test download fully&

    security, maybe xor encryption

    mutex lock or semaphores for writing data

    double check that util.c fuctions are working, seems so at the moment(THESE CHANGES ARE ON TEST BRANCH):
        once checked, clean project to use utils.c functions
        
    make setBlockingFd more efficient by checking if it is already in the mode specified, maybe using static variable

    check if a username already exists
    
    check if a filename already exists

    fix defines for array lengths

    check security - functions like strcpy to strncpy

    wait for to be fully sent before recv?
