TODO: 
    security, maybe xor encryption

    check if a filename already exists

    fix defines for array lengths

    check security - functions like strcpy to strncpy

    change uploadFile to not memcpy the struct. just write info directly into the array

    Change "idx" in share file to fileIdx

    Sending files the user can download still a bit weird
